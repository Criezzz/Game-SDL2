This game uses a development library called SDL from [here](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/).

# **Introduction**
This is a small SDL2 project done by me and Qu√¢n [@Darkin72](https://github.com/Darkin72). It is a 2-player competitive snake game whose win conditions are getting higher scores or sabotaging opponent's playground until they die! (ingame, ofc).

# **Prerequisite**
1. This version only supports `Window OS` and `64-bit`.
2. Require `WinRAR`.  Download it [here](https://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&L=0).

# **Installation**
1. Download file `.rar` [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kByUezcMyE8_K2BO2rRx4nef4X7LIeFG/view?usp=sharing).
2. Extract using `WinRAR`.
3. Run `SDL2Game1.exe`.
4. Enjoy!
