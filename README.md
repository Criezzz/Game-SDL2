This game project uses a development library called SDL from [here](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/).

# **Introduction**
This is a small SDL2 project done by me and Quân [@Darkin72](https://github.com/Darkin72) used as the submission for our class's assignment (INT2215_51).
1. Information: 
- Phùng Hải Nam - 23020122.
- Lương Duy Quân - 23020140.
2. Content brief:
  This is a 2-player competitive snake game whose win conditions are getting higher scores or sabotaging opponent's playground until they die by eating special apples! (ingame, ofc). Scoring in this game is different from other snake games (apple has a fixed score), as you have to choose the shortest path to the apple to get the highest possible score.
3. Expected mark: 9 - 9.5
4. Reasons: 
- Original idea only using SDL2 template of Lazy Foo's tutorial [here](https://lazyfoo.net/).
- Using updated built-in class `SDL_Texture` instead of old `SDL_Surface` to render textures out.
- Self-designing art (using Aseprite on Steam).
- Has sound effect and background music.
- Using BFS to calculate score.

# **Demo**
Short demo [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jl2cRx0EVdsTvcAKlNrKQ6vSj6_f3lCG/view?usp=sharing).
_Note:_ The fullscreen toggle is a bit buggy due to my screen capturing program, but it works fine in game.
